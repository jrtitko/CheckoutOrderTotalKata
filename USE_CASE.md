Use Case 1: Accept a scanned item. The total should reflect an increase by the eaches price after the scan. You will need a way to configure the prices of scannable items prior to being scanned.  

Use Case 2: Accept a scanned item and a weight. The total should reflect an increase of the price of the item for the given weight.  

Implement PriceService  

Use Case 3: Support a markdown. A marked-down item will reflect the eaches cost less the markdown when scanned. A weighted item with a markdown will reflect that reduction in cost per unit.
